# Welcome to My Cybersecurity Projects Repository

This repository contains several projects developed during my internship at Prodigy Infotech. Each project focuses on different aspects of cybersecurity, including password management and keylogging. Below, you'll find an overview of each project with links to their respective detailed README files.

## Projects Overview

Password Complexity Checker & Vault
## 🔐 Password Complexity Checker:
This project includes a password complexity checker using the zxcvbn library. It evaluates password strength and checks for breaches using the "Have I Been Pwned" API.

## 🔏 Password Vault:
A secure password vault feature allows users to store passwords safely. Passwords are encrypted with the cryptography library and managed via an SQLite database.

## 🔑 Master Password & Recovery Key:
Users create a master password, which derives an encryption key using PBKDF2 with SHA-256. Additionally, a unique recovery key, generated with UUID and hashed with SHA-256, ensures account recovery if the master password is forgotten.

# Keylogger
## 🖥️ Keylogger:
This project involves the development of a keylogger using Python. It captures keystrokes and logs them for security auditing purposes. The keylogger is designed to run discreetly in the background and store the captured data in a secure format.

## 🔧 Features:

Captures keystrokes in real-time.
Stores logged data securely.
Option to send logs to a remote server for centralized monitoring.
